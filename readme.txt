Post Thumbnail From URL is a plugin to quickly import images from the web straight to your Media Library using a public URL. You will be able to do that from the Featured Image Metabox in the Post edit page

== Description ==

This plugin was created to make easier the life of people that want to get pictures, images, photos from the web, rather than download your image on your computer and, then, upload it in your media library, you can paste the image url in the field and get it from the web straight in your media library. Afterword you can click to set the post thumbnail and you will find the aquired image in your media library, ready to be inserted in your post.

This plugin is a simple box, activate the plugin, follow the settings link, activate the option to see the new form in the post thumbnail metabox in the post edit page and it's done!

I created this plugin mainly for me, when I was creating websites I incurred the need to quickly grab some of my photos from another website ands that was the reason of this idea, it is something like creating a tunnel from one site to another to transfer images.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `post-thumbnail-from-url` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Follow the "settings" link from the plugin page or click "Post thumbnail from url" link in the settings menu
4. Activate the option to make visible the FORM to get images using URLs
